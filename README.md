Priority Queue implementation for n processes

To compile run:
javac Main.java 
To run
java Main 


- Add a value to the priority queue using process.insertIntoQueue(value)
- Remove the value using process.deleteFromQueue()
- Find the minimum through queue.findMin()

Every 32 bit integer in the queue is divided as follows:
first 16 bits store the int value, the last 32 bit store the (date + hour + min) 
(so max int value that can be stored is 65,536)
